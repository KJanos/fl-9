          <p>Escape the winter crowds and seek out one of nature’s most fabulous show, the Aurora Borealis, at Torassieppi,
            in breath-taking Finnish Lapland.</p>

        <h1>Who am I</h1>
        <p>
          I’m a self-made billionaire inventor, I’ve worked at NASA and CERN. Explored 8 continents including Atlantis. Won 2 Nobel
          prizes, a Pulitzer, six Grammys and People magazine’s sexiest man alive 3 years running. I’m currently working
          on developing cold fusion reactors that will provide free clean, sustainable energy to all mankind for centuries
          ahead.
        </p>
        <p>Oh, and I also take photos in my spare time.</p>
        <p>At least this is how I’d like my bio to read. :-)</p>
        <p>Truth is that I have a very cool job. Over the last fifteen years, I have shot commercial lifestyle images for stock
          photography agencies such as Jupiterimages, Corbis, and Getty Images. I’ve been lucky to work with some amazing
          people, both at these agencies and on my teams of models, producers, stylists, and assistants. I’ve had my photos
          published for editorial and commercial purposes all over the world and have had some great commercial clients along
          the way as well. In the last five years, I switched to shooting travel images and fell in love with photography
          all over again.</p>
